nws 1.3.1
---------
1. Allow nwsListWss and nwsListVars to return result in data frame or string.
2. Split sleigh.R to several files
   - move sleighPending class to sleighPending.R
   - move internal functions to sleigh.internal.R
   - move workerLoop to workerLoop.R
   - move sshcmd, rshcmd, and lsfcmd to cmdLaunchOptions.R
3. Add launch.R which includes different ways to launch remote workers
   - web launch
   - cmd launch, which launches workers from worker script
4. Add DEBUG flag to eachElem and eachWorker
5. Add verbose mode to sleigh
6. Allow user to specify chunkSize of each task in eachElem invocation
7. Switched from make.socket to socketConnection to allow binary data
to be sent to the NWS server.
8  Changed serialization of objects from ascii to binary.
9. Added new example programs.
10. Add local launch mechanism, and made it the default launch method.
11. Fixed a problem where loading a saved R workspace fails if a sleigh
object was in the workspace.

nws 1.3.2
---------
1. Added support for service launch mechanism.
2. Properly quoted the commands to start the workers in addWorker function.
3. Added logDir option to sleigh constructor.
4. Changed the default working directory of workers to be the same as the
master.
5. Changed the rules for the "cmd launch functions" to return vectors rather
than strings.
6. Greatly improved the support for Windows in sleigh, including the
addition of Windows services for the executing the server, babelfish,
and sleigh workers.

nws 1.3.3
---------
1. Added nwsServer and netWorkSpace convenience functions.
2. Added sleighPro convenience function.
3. Fix rshcmd function to conform to Windows rsh cmd, and 
   add '-n' option to redirect standard input to /dev/null. 

nws 1.3.4
---------
1. Modified nwsStore to support the R 2.4 version of serialize.
2. Added prototype arguments to various setClass calls to prevent R from
instantiating default nwsServer objects which caused warning message during
build/installation.

nws 1.3.5
---------
1. Added some underlying support needed for fault tolerant versions of
   the eachElem and eachWorker sleigh methods.

nws 1.3.6
---------
1. Modified the RNWSSleighWorker scripts to use the value of the sleigh
   scriptDir option to help them find the nws package on the worker machines.
2. Modified workerLoop.R to print out more information in less space in
   the "worker info" variable.  Included the location of the log file
   and the version of R.
3. Fixed use of the export command in RNWSSleighWorker.sh that made it
   incompatible with some shells other than bash and zsh.

nws 1.4.0
---------
1. Added support for iterated operations.
2. Modified workerLoop.R to log errors to the sleigh workspace, in
   addition to the log file.

nws 1.5.0
---------
1. Fixed a bug in RNWSSleighWorker.py that causes a sleigh to fail.
   This is particularly a problem on Windows, where RNWSSleighWorker.py
   is the default worker script.
2. Created a workspace when constructing a sleigh that is reserved for
   the user.  The worker functions can access it via the SleighUserNws
   variable.
3. Added nwsStoreFile, nwsFindFile, nwsFileTryFile, nwsFetchFile, and
   nwsFetchTryFile methods to the netWorkSpace class.
4. Added error checking for optional arguments passed to sleigh,
   netWorkSpace, nwsOpenWs, and nwsUseWs.  That can help detect spelling
   errors that might otherwise go undetected.
5. Added the "closure" option to eachWorker and eachElem.  If it is set
   to FALSE, the enclosing environment will be removed, which may
   prevent transferring a huge amount of data in the serialized function
   of every task object.
6. Added warnings to eachWorker and eachElem if the worker function
   looks like a closure, but the "closure" option hasn't been explicitly
   specified.
7. Added status method to sleigh class.
8. Included the lsfSleigh launch function in the standard version of nws.
9. Removed sleighPro class, since all its functionality is in the
   standard sleigh class.
10. Included a new parallel kmeans sleigh example.
11. Added defaultSleighOptions environment that can be used to change
   the default options when constructing sleigh objects.

nws 1.5.1
---------
1. Added a stdout/stderr redirection to RNWSSleighWorker.sh to avoid
   getting error messages on the user's console when calling stopSleigh.
2. Added parallel random forest examples/benchmarks.
3. Improved some of the examples to be useful for benchmarking.

nws 1.6.0
---------
1. The "Pro" version of nws is renamed to nwsPro.
2. Added export and unexport methods to the sleigh class.

nws 1.6.1
---------
1. Added workerInfo method to sleigh class.
2. Changed default value of 'user' parameter for sleigh constructor to NULL.
   When using ssh, this means the '-l' option isn't used, which allows the
   ssh config file to be used to use host specific users, which is very useful
   in a heterogeneous environment.
3. Modified the values in the "worker info" variable in the sleigh workspace
   to include the nws version string.
4. Reduced volume of output to the log file in verbose mode.

nws 1.6.2
---------
1. Removed sleigh dependency on nwsserver >= 1.4.0.  The workerInfo and
   export methods won't work, but the workers should not die if using an
   older server.
2. Changed RNWSSleighWorker.py to make the worker process a process group
   leader (on Unix) to aid in kill any forked child processes.
3. Fixed bug in RNWSSleighWorker.py caused by adding '%in%' into a string
   that was processed using the '%' operator.  This bug was introduced in
   version 1.6.0, but would only be a problem on Windows (by default).
4. Fixed bug in SleighWorkerWrapper.sh that occurred if using some shells
   other than bash and zsh.
5. Exported the close method as a method, rather than a function in the
   NAMESPACE file.

nws 1.6.3
---------
1. Miscellaneous example improvements.
2. Added pportfolio as a demo.
3. The fix to SleighWorkerWrapper.sh in 1.6.2 still doesn't work in
   cases where zsh is invoked as /bin/sh, because it seems to emulate
   older Bourne shells, but the SHELL environment variable is still
   "/bin/zsh".  I gave up trying to close descriptors 10-99.
4. Fixed bug in nwsFindTryFile.
5. Added sshforwardcmd function for tunneling the sleigh workers'
   connections to the nws server through ssh.

nws 1.7.x.0
-----------
1. The "Pro" version of nws is renamed back to nws.
2. Fixed bug in the "File" methods (nwsFetchFile, etc).
3. Fixed some potential bugs when storing and fetching binary data.
4. Added new functions batchNodeList, sgeNodeList, lsfNodeList, and
   pbsNodeList to provide better support for running sleigh programs
   as batch jobs under SGE, LSF, and PBS.
5. Modified the nws store operations to not serialize raw vectors.
   In this respect, they are treated like strings, but are distinguished
   from strings.
6. Enhanced babelfish support.
7. Added "rwin" function for launching remote sleigh workers on Windows.

nws 1.8.x.0
-----------
1. Added support for creating heterogeneous sleighs.  This is done via the
   new nodeSleighOptions environment.
2. Added the view method to the sleigh, nwsServer, and netWorkSpace classes.
   This displays the nws server's web interface in a browser.
3. Fixed a bug that could cause eachWorker to hang if a particular error
   occurred in a previous call to eachWorker.
4. Removed the sleigh simpleQuote option, but added a mechanism to allow
   the launch function to specify the quoting mechanism for each command.
   This is only applicable to Windows.
5. Improved various error messages.


nws 2.0.x.0
-----------
1. Added support for the new sleigh workspace server plugins.
   This has a number of benefits, depending on what plugins your server has
   installed.
2. Added support for automatically starting an nws server.
3. Improved the efficiency of fetching/finding serialized objects.
4. Getting the location of the Python interpreter in the registry on Windows.
5. Added support for distributed random number generation using SPRNG.
6. Changed default value of scriptName to use Python worker script.
7. Changed default value of scriptExec to use scriptcmd.
8. Modified sleigh worker startup to allow multiple workers per sentinel.
9. Changed default value of showDataFrame to TRUE in nwsListVars and nwsListWss.
10. Allow multiple eachElem/eachWorkers jobs with blocking=FALSE when using
   the sleigh workspace plugin.
11. Added setSleigh and getSleigh functions that used to be part of the
   sleighMan package.
